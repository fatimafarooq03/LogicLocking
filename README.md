## Implementation of UNSAIL 
Leading semiconductor companies such as Apple® and Qualcomm® deploy third party foundries that gain access to the company’s ntegrated circuit (IC) designs. There may be attackers present in the IC supply chain that can compromise the security of the underlying hardware during fabrication, testing, assembly, and packaging through launching hardware-orientated attacks. Logic locking intends to protect the intellectual property of IC designs throughout the globalized supply chain, however the SAIL attack, based on tailored machine learning models, circumvents combinational logic locking. Therefore, the objective of my summer research project was to implement UNSAIL, an effective technique to overcome oracle- less, machine learning based attacks on logic locking. UNSAIL’s main algorithm involves inserting specific key-gate structures that confuse ML models like those used in SAIL. Firstly, I implemented random logic locking through preparing C++ scripts that handled gate level netlists. I, then, encoded the specific gates which constituted of a key input, through preparing a separate script. Then, I synthesized the locked circuit and then worked out an algorithm and coded it that compared the key gate structures before and after synthesis. After comparison, I was able to achieve the prime purpose of UNSAIL, to insert specific key gate structures to the synthesized locked circuit, the gates that were modified during synthesis, to ultimately achieve UNSAIL. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59decdbf-1e3e-48c2-a245-7a1ce10e3517)
